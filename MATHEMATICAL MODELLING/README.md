# Mathematical Modelling

This repository contains projects related to mathematical modelling in the field of network flow analysis. The implementation of linear programming models has been realized using __AMPL__ (A Mathematical Programming Language).

## Projects:

### [PROJECT 1: Flow Networks and Assignment Tasks](flow_networks_and_assignment_tasks)
This project focuses on the analysis and modelling of flow networks, with a specific emphasis on assignment tasks. Explore the subfolder for detailed documentation, task formulation, source code, and relevant files.

### [PROJECT 2: Multicommodity Flow Network](multicommodity_flow_network)
In this project, we delve into the realm of multicommodity flow networks, examining their properties and applications. Visit the subfolder for more information, documentation, and code.

## Usage
