# Mathematical Modelling

This repository contains projects related to mathematical modelling in the field of network flow analysis. The implementation of linear programming models has been realized using __AMPL__ (A Mathematical Programming Language).

## Projects:

### [PROJECT 1: Flow Networks and Assignment Tasks](Flow%20Networks%20and%20Assignment%20Tasks%20-%20PROJECT%201)
This project focuses on the analysis and modelling of flow networks, with a specific emphasis on assignment tasks. Explore the subfolder for detailed documentation, task formulation, source code, and relevant files.

### [PROJECT 2: Multicommodity Flow Network](Multicommodity%20Flow%20Network%20-%20PROJECT%202)
In this project, we delve into the realm of multicommodity flow networks, examining their properties and applications. Visit the subfolder for more information, documentation, and code.
