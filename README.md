# Machine Learning and Data Structures Projects

Welcome to my project repository! Here, you'll find a diverse collection of projects covering Machine Learning, Algorithms, and Data Structures. Some projects originated from coursework during my Computer Science studies at Warsaw University of Technology, while others are personal exercises for continuous learning and skill development.

Projects marked with a tilde (~) prefix in their folder names indicate that comprehensive documentation is pending. I'm actively working on enhancing documentation to improve clarity and understanding.

**Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!**
